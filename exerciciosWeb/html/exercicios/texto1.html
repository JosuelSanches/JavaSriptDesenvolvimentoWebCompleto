    Mongol women enjoyed, or some would say endured, 
    a vital role in the often times harsh nomadic life. 
    In recent decades, women saw greater
     equality in education and the workplace. 
    As Mongolia continues to shape
     its identity in the modern world, 
    this essay examines some of the issues
     and opportunities facing women today.
