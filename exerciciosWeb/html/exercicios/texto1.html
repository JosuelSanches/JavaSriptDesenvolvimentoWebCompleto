    Mongol women enjoyed, or some would say endured,<br> 
    a vital role in the often times harsh nomadic life. <br>
    In recent decades, women saw greater<br>
     equality in education and the workplace.<br> 
    As Mongolia continues to shape<br>
     its identity in the modern world,<br> 
    this essay examines some of the issues<br>
     and opportunities facing women today.<br>
